# Empty Example for WP2WS (p5.js, ml5.js and three.js libraries included)

Click **"Remix to edit"** that appears at the right top corner! :D

___

If you see **the red dots** with the error message **"is not defined"** and you are confident that the variable or function is from p5.js, ml5.js, three.js or what you defined, you can list the variable and function name at the top of your .js file, following the syntax below: 

```javascript
/* global createCanvas, background, width, ... , (add more) */
```

I already listed most of p5.js variables and functions for you. If you find any variable or function missing, please report me (Moon <jh.moon@nyu.edu>). Thank you!
